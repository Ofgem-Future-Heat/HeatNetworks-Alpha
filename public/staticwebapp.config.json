// We are hosting in an Azure Static Web App with client side routing, we noticed pages weren't routing correctly on page refresh.
// Research revealed that we must add application config to support this, as described in Microsofts docs:

// "Single Page Applications often rely on client-side routing. These client-side routing rules update the browser's window location without making requests back to the server. If you refresh the page, or go directly to URLs generated by client-side routing rules, a server-side fallback route is required to serve the appropriate HTML page, which is generally the index.html for your client-side app.
// You can define a fallback rule by adding a navigationFallback section. The following example returns /index.html for all static file requests that don't match a deployed file"
// https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#fallback-routes

    "navigationFallback": {
    "rewrite": "/index.html"
    }
